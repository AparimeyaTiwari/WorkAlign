## **Problem Statement**

Finding the right company isn’t just about skills or pay. Many candidates struggle to answer:

* Does the company’s **culture and values** align with mine?
* How does the **hiring process** work, and what skills are actually valued?
* What do employees really think about **work-life balance, leadership, and growth**?

Companies also lack insights into how they are **perceived externally**, which can affect hiring and retention.
